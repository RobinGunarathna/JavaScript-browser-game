# Meteorite Lover The Game!

A 2D javaScript game!

Collect meteorites!

Website: https://robingunarathna.github.io/JavaScript-browser-game/

## purpose of project

Portfolio 2 project for code institute!

I've always wanted to create a game so this was the perfect opportunity!

## Features

Very simple website with a simple game that's not done yet!

There are instructions on the Website and under the instructions you'll find the game.

The game is very simple just click were you want to move the alien to collect meteorites.

### Features I would like to add

I want to add a scoreboard so you can track the score and a timer so you have 30 or 60 seconds to collect as many meteorites as you can.

I was planning on adding that now but I don't know how and i didn't understand the tutorials that I watched on how to do it.

So I will do it when I have more time and have learned how to. Or if I fail and have to edit this to get a pass...

## Typography and color scheme

Just a simple black background and simple white text to fit the games colors.

## Testing

I tested that this website works in: Google chrome, Microsoft edge and google chrome on my android phone.

I tested this websites responsiveness using devtools device toolbar and it's not responsive it worked on my phone but when I do it in devtools it doesn't work.

I don't know how to fix the issue with devtools i tried with media querys but it didn't work.

##  Deployment

I deployed the website with github-pages.

## Buugs

Had a bug when you changed the size of the browser that made it so when you clicked on the postion you want to move the alien to instead of moveing the alien to that position it moved him somewere else.

I don't know if the responsiveness is bugging or if i'm doing something wrong cause sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
